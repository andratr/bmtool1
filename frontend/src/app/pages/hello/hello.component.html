  Welcome to my project on <strong>benchmarking AI techniques</strong> for the modernization
  of legacy systems at ING.
</p>

<p>
  Legacy codebases, often written in <strong>COBOL</strong> and <strong>PL/SQL</strong>,
  pose significant challenges for migration to modern platforms.
  This project evaluates and compares different <strong>AI-driven approaches</strong>
  to showcase how automation can accelerate and improve the process of code transformation.
