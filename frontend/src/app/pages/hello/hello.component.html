    <p>
  Welcome to my project on <strong>benchmarking AI techniques</strong> for the use case of legacy systems modernization at ING.
</p>

<p>
  Legacy codebases, often written in <strong>COBOL</strong> and <strong>PL/SQL</strong>,
  pose significant challenges for migration to modern platforms.
  This project evaluates and compares different <strong>AI-driven approaches</strong>
  to showcase how automation can accelerate and improve the process of code transformation.
</p>

    <p>
        This project builds on and is inspired by
        <em>Leveraging LLMs for Automated Translation of Legacy Code: A Case Study on PL/SQL to Java Transformation</em>
        (arXiv:2508.19663, 2025).
        I’m grateful for guidance and feedback from my supervisors—
        <strong>Andrea Capiluppi</strong> (university supervisor),
        <strong>Jonck van der Kogel</strong> (ING supervisor),
        and <strong>Zahra Moti</strong> (peer researcher / project peer), whose insights directly shaped the experimental design,
        evaluation criteria, and interpretation of results.
