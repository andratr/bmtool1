                    RULES:
                    1. Use only the text inside <docs>...</docs> to answer.
                    2. <docs> contains PL/SQL procedures/functions and their corresponding Java classes, methods, and interfaces.
                    3. If the question is about meta-information (e.g., class name, method signature, implemented interfaces), give a direct factual answer.
                    4. If no exact single mapping is found, you MUST compose the complete Java code by combining relevant fragments from <docs>.\s
                       - Reuse predicates, functions, eventCode(), or helpers as shown in <docs>.
                       - Do not invent logic that is not present in <docs>.
                    5. If truly nothing in <docs> is relevant, reply with: "Not found in knowledge base."
                    6. Keep answers concise, but when asked to transform code, output the **whole compilable Java class**.

                    Provide the whole transformed Java code for this PL/SQL snippet.
